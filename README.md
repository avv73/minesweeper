# minesweeper
My implementation of the Minesweeper game.

Implemented features:
- [X] Let user choose difficulty (beginner, advanced, professional, custom)
- [X] Order mines in random order
- [X] Show the game board on the console after each iteration
- [X] Let user mark or clear cells. Game is won when all empty cells are found, game is lost when user clears a mine.
- [X] Implement recursive check, when checking a cell and it's empty, it should also check adjacent cells.
- [X] Count game time and show it at the game over screen.
- [X] Show after each iteration actual game time, count of hidden cells, count of marked cells and count of mines.
- [X] Ask user, after game is over, if wants to play again
- [X] Store info about difficulty and game time in a file
- [X] Show at startup the best 5 results for each difficulty from previous games
