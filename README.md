# minesweeper
My implementation of the Minesweeper game.

Implemented features:
- [ ] Let user choose difficulty (beginner, advanced, professional, custom)
- [X] Order mines in random order
- [X] Show the game board on the console after each iteration
- [ ] Let user mark or clear cells. Game is won when all empty cells are found.
- [ ] Implement recursive check, when checking a cell and it's empty, it should also check adjacent cells.
- [ ] Count game time and should it at the game over screen.
- [ ] Show after each iteration actual game time, count of hidden cells, count of marked cells and count of mines.
- [ ] Ask user, after game is over, if wants to play again
- [ ] Store info about difficulty and game time in a file
- [ ] Show at startup the best 5 results from previous games
